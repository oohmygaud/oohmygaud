# Audrey Bound


**Hi**, I’m Audrey!

+ I have extensive experience building engaging frontend user experiences in React. The projects I have designed solve real world problems, and I try to write beautiful, efficient code.

+ I’m a passionate and motivated worker! Being a self-taught software developer has taught me how to manage my time and motivate myself to keep pushing forward progress. I set daily and weekly goals.

+ I’m determined to solve problems, and I love reading documentation to implement new tools!

+ I love learning about the latest technologies, and I try to stay ahead of the learning curve of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries!
