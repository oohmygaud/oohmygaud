**Hi**, I’m Audrey! I'm a full-stack developer, software consultant, co-founder, and life-long learner!

+ I'm currently working on a hybrid livestreaming-slash-video-conferencing platform. The team is very small, and I wear a lot of hats! I'm building the backend scene controls layer in Django, and designing and implementing the corresponding frontend React components.

+ I have extensive experience building engaging frontend user experiences in React. The projects I have designed solve real world problems, and I try to write beautiful, efficient code.

+ I’m a passionate and motivated worker! Being a self-taught software developer has taught me how to manage my time and motivate myself to keep pushing forward progress. I set daily and weekly goals.

+ I’m determined to solve problems, and I love reading documentation to implement new tools!

+ I love learning about the latest technologies, and I try to stay ahead of the learning curve of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries! In 2018, I attended the **Consensys Academy** for Ethereum SmartContract development in Solidity, thanks to a full scholarship from Consensys.
